**MyUplink Schedule changer.**

This program connect to the myuplink.com and adjust the schedule of [HÃ¸iax CONNECTED](https://www.hoiax.no/om-hoiax/articles/hoiax-connected-smart-varmtvannsbereder-med-skylosning) hot water heaters, and adjust the schedule so that it uses electricity when the price is low.
It also allows you to periodicity publish current values from the heater via mqtt to your home automation of choice.
